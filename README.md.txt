# Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of mobile device usage among 700 users, using R for data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and behavioral segmentation. The report covers summary statistics, demographic analysis, correlation studies, and actionable recommendations for developers, manufacturers, and service providers.

## Dataset
- 700 users
- Features: Device model, OS (Android/iOS), app usage time, screen time, battery drain, number of apps, data usage, age, gender, user behavior class

## Analysis Process
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and visualizations
- Correlation analysis
- User segmentation by behavior class
- Recommendations for stakeholders

## Key Findings
- Heavy users (Class 5) drive most battery and data consumption
- Android users dominate the dataset
- Usage behavior is more predictive than age or gender
- Strong correlation between screen time, app usage, and resource drain

## Files
- `R.docx` (or `R.pdf`): Full report
- `analysis.R`: R code for EDA and visualizations
- `visualizations/`: Folder with exported graphs

## How to Run
1. Open `analysis.R` in RStudio.
2. Install required packages: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `corrplot`, `readxl`, `reshape2`, `scales`.
3. Run the script to reproduce the analysis.
